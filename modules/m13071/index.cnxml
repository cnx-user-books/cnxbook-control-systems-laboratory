<title>Choosing Lab Hardware</title>
<para id="id9741967">The lab currently uses the hardware laid out as option one (1) below, LabVIEW Real-Time Module for ETS with PXI hardware.  However, there are several hardware combinations that can be used for implementation of a Real-Time system to control ETS
plants using LabVIEW. These options each have their own benefits.
The options have been broken down by Real Time OS software
support.</para>

<title>LabVIEW Real-Time Module for ETS</title>
<para id="id9837553">The LabVIEW Real-Time Module for ETS targets
is for real-time devices that use a single dedicated kernel running
embedded code. This option can be purchased from National
Instruments for real-time PXI targets. It is also used for desktop
PCs running as a dedicated real-time target.

</para><para id="element-802">1. This option consists of a Windows PC communicating with a PXI real-time controller running LabVIEW Real-Time OS.  The PXI-7831R intelligent data acquisition board is connected to the controller through the PXI bus.  Control loops can be executed on both the Real-Time controller and on the intelligent data acquisition board.  The <link resource="ECP-RIO_Adapter.pdf">ECP-RIO Adapter cable </link> connects the 68pin VHDCI connector from the MIO connector on the PXI-7831R to the round encoder cable connected directly to the ECP plant.

<title>The LabVIEW Real-Time Module for RTX</title>
<para id="id10178598">The LabVIEW Real-Time Module for RTX targets
is used with desktop PCs running RTX, a real-time extension for
Windows. This real-time operating system runs in parallel with
Windows on the same processor, providing a single box solution for
both user interface and deterministic operations. The OS can be
purchased from National Instruments or from Venturecom directly.
LabVIEW for RTX is a single PC solution for Real Time
processing.</para>

<para id="id10297492">Each solution uses the National Instruments
PCI-7831R Reconfigurable FPGA. The FPGA is most useful because it
offers 8 analog inputs, 8 analog outputs, and 96 digital I/O lines
making it scalable for both teaching applications and research. The
on board FPGA can be given a fixed personality for student use, or
can be reprogrammed with the LabVIEW FPGA Module specifically for
your needs. PID control loop rates up to 200,000 Hz. The 7831R also
allows custom safety features to be implemented in the FPGA to
protect students and equipment. Because these safety features are
implemented in hardware, they are not dependent on the stability of
the code running on the PC or real-time OS.</para><para id="element-373"><link url="http://www.ni.com/pdf/manuals/370489b.pdf">
